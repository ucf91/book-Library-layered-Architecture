# book-Library-layered-Architecture
- This is a console book library application with many features :show all,home,search,add,edit,delete

- This app has been implemented in pure java, No thirdparty library or frameworks used except maven build tool

- I used the layered architecture along with SOLID principles to make the application loosely coupled , reusable and extensible 
So it will be easy to reuse booklibraryapi in web application or desktop GUI.

- As dependecy injection is the best practice to make the components loosely coupled I've created my own Injector in pure java.
